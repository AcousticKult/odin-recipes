    <p>This is the perfect comfort food on a busy night! The whole thing comes together in one pot in about 45 minutes. It's a super affordable hearty meal created from pantry staples. Great with a glass of wine. Garnish each serving with Parmesan and fresh flat-leaf parsley.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>¾ cup finely chopped yellow onion</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup vodka</li>
        <li>2½ cups water</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package uncooked penne pasta</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Select High temperature setting, and preheat the pot for 1 to 2 minutes. Add butter and oil. Add onion and cook, stirring constantly, until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and crushed red pepper, and cook, stirring often, for 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>Pour in vodka and cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Cancel Saute function. Stir in water, penne, and salt. Pour tomatoes over penne; do not stir. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 4 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
        <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Stir in cream and Parmesan cheese; let stand for 3 minutes. Stir in pepper.</li>
    </ol>

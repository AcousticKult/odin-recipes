## About The Project

This is the first project from [The Odin Project's Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations), titled ['Recipes'](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes).

My learnings from this project include:
* Setting up a basic website using HTML
* Use of various HTML tags and elements like headings, lists, anchor tags, among others
* Use of basic CSS styling syntax for color, typography, etc.
* Creating a project directory which includes different webpages and assets used for the website
* Version control using Git and GitHub
